# Detection_of_Brute_force_Attack_tool
Introduction:-

Bruteforce attacks pose a significant risk to the security of online systems, from web applications and SSH servers to database access. These attacks often involve automated tools that attempt a large number of login attempts in a short period. This project aims to develop a robust detection tool that can identify and alert administrators to ongoing bruteforce attempts, enabling timely actions.

Project Goals:-

Develop a monitoring system: A system that can effectively monitor authentication attempts on a target service (e.g., SSH, web login, RDP).

Implement detection logic: This algorithms to identify patterns indicative of bruteforce attacks (e.g., failed login attempts from a single IP, multiple failed attempts across different usernames).

Provide alerting mechanisms: This methods to notify administrators of detected attacks (e.g., email, SMS, logging).

Offer basic mitigation suggestions: Provide guidance on potential actions to take upon attack detection.
